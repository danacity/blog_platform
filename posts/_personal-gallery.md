## Show your work

Historically one thing I have struggle with was showing my work, I have tons of projects all at different stages of completeness, but almost non I felt I proud to share. Even those that were "done" required drastic improvements in their documentation to be useable by others, So they need up just sitting in one of the many code graveyards I have created over the years. ![code graveyard](/public/images/code_graveyard.jpg)
## Time for change

I have always known I need to show my work, I just never got around to it, always moving from one project to another.  While participating in the [Solve It With Code](https://solveit.fast.ai/)course by Jeromy Howard and the Answer.AI I became obsessed with building with FastHTML and MonserUI, but this time I didn't want my code to just die on my local computer or a repo no one will ever see. I wanted to incorporate what I was learning into something I could share with the community as well as showcase my new full stack skills, I wanted to build . 


If your interested I wrote a blog post about [building full stack apps with fasthtml](posts/full-stack.md)
