## I Hate JavaScript
Like lima beans, JavaScript is something I just can't stomach, no matter how it's prepared, it's just not right. Every time I see JavaScript, I feel compelled to tell everyone how much I hate it, and overall most people agree, the only defense heard is "Yeah but, you need to eat your vegetables." but surely there must be a better way. For a very long time, I felt that my distaste for JavaScript was holding me back, but every time I tried, I just couldn't stomach it.

With the advancement of AI-powered tools like Bolt.new, Chatgpt-Canvas, Devin, Anthropic-Artifacts, OpenHands, etc., I started to feel it might be time to try lima beans again, I mean JavaScript. Based on my most recent experience there are 3 unsolved problems when using AI to build web applications that are worth talking about:
 1. JavaScript 
 2. AI Limitations
 3. No Clear Path to Production

#### 1. JavaScript (Lima beans)
Web development is like a kitchen that keeps coming up with new ways to serve lima beans: React, Vue.js, Angular, Svelte, Solid - they're all just different seasonings on the same vegetable I don't want to eat. And when you add in HTML, CSS, and back-end integrations, it's like they're hiding lima beans in every dish. To me it's simple, I'm not going to learn it at this stage of my career. If I have to use it, I'll either have to pay someone to build it or hope an AI can do the job.

#### 2. AI Limitations (Stop talking so much)
The arrival of GPT-4o and Anthropic 3.5 Sonnet in mid-2024 finally convinced me that we are close to having AIs could help cook up usable code. During the Berkeley Agent MOOC Hackathon, I decided to test this by building a Human-in-the-lead Agent powered Knowledge Management tool. Using bolt.new, the results were magical at first - with each prompt, I could see my vision taking shape on screen. But as the code grew more complex, my token usage exploded, and the magic faded. The models were better but the walls of code the models produced were impossible for me to control, each fix led to new breaks, creating an endless cycle of patches and problems. As the hackathon deadline approached, my hope turned to disappointment. 

#### 3. No Clear Path to Production (It works-ish, now what)
As I approached my token limit on multiple services and the hackathon deadline, I discovered a huge hole in my plan. Even if I got the front end to be exactly what I was envisioning, there was still the tremendous hurdle of integrating it with a Python backend. Sure, I could use FastAPI or Flask, but managing WebSocket, permissions, authentication and all that is no small task, especially since my extremely outdated website was powered by WordPress(PHP).

### Three Strikes You're Out
Even though I had fun and learned a lot, the hackathon revealed that web development was my Achilles' heel. I had wasted too much time, and my last minute attempt to limit the scope was too late to salvage it. Failure can be a powerful learning tool, with the wounds of the hackathon still fresh, I didn't have the time for a pity party, I jumped into the already underway [Solve It With Code](https://solveit.fast.ai/) course, the brainchild of the amazing Jeremy Howard and Answer.ai Team. I've personally loved just about everything Jeremy has ever made, his courses and teaching methods made it possible for me to successfully transition my career from retail banking into Data Science (that and 10,000 hours of blood, sweat, and tears).

### The Plot Twist
Tenacity has its rewards. The Solve it with code course perfectly demonstrated what many of us already knew about working with AI: break down problems, learn from the AI, and get it to stop talking so much. Timing is everything, Jeremy's words excited me to build. The course reintroduced me to FastHTML, reinforced AI paired programming best practices, and introduced me to MonsterUI, my missing link, the path to production was in sight, with the entire stack in Python. No need to understand what flavor of JavaScript has the feature I need.

```seriously, why do they keep flavoring it? Which one would you like, lima bean dream or dead mouse?.```

It has been under a month and I am building full-stack applications without needing to understand JavaScript, iterating with AI without walls of code, and putting them into production. Running this blog platform that didn't require sacrificing my sanity to JavaScript frameworks, and finally feeling like a proper full-stack data scientist. I really feel like it is a super power, but only because of the struggle to get here. 

Stay tuned for more posts where I'll dive into how I built this blog platform using FastHTML and my SolveIT experience.

```I can't promise I won't throw some more shade at JavaScript. Old habits die hard, after all.```
