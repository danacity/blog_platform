title: TIL - Can you make a Desktop application in Python
date: 2025-01-24
draft: false
excerpt: My friend asked me of Python had an electron alternative that could make it possible for the user to access the local file system, so I felt compelled to find out.

## Background

I was sharing my quest to build a human in the lead knowledge management tool where users can interact with AI agents, like obsidian/notion, my friend asked if it was going to be "just a web-app" or can it interact with local files. I originally thought I was just building it for me so I was Ok with running it on my local system, but his comment really made me think, if I do want to offer this to other people, there is little to no chance people would want to do all the work of setting it all up. JavaScript has Electron, does python have a way to server a webapp as a desktop application?

A quick web search identified a few potential solutions, the one the struck me as the best option was PyWebView, I was intrigued enough to take it to the next step, lets see if we can build a super simple MVP that has the user pick a folder and prints the file name (just to prove the webapp could have access to the local file system)

## Result

It took some debugging with an issue with webView2(Edge Chromium ) falling back to the other IE-based Web Browser, but after a few hours I had a PS1 script that creates a conda environment, downloads dependencies, and launches the application:

```ps1
@"
import webview
from pathlib import Path

def open_folder_dialog(window):
    # Let the user know we're opening the folder picker
    window.evaluate_js(
        'document.getElementById("messages").textContent = "Opening folder dialog...";'
    )

    # Prompt the user to pick a folder
    folder = window.create_file_dialog(webview.FOLDER_DIALOG)
    if folder:
        folder_path = folder[0]
        # Update the UI with the selected folder path
        window.evaluate_js(
            f'document.getElementById("messages").innerHTML = "User selected folder:<br>{folder_path}<br><br>";'
        )

        p = Path(folder_path)
        if p.is_dir():
            # Build an HTML string of the file names
            file_list_html = ""
            for entry in p.iterdir():
                file_list_html += f"{entry.name}<br>"

            # Insert that file list into the page
            window.evaluate_js(
                f'document.getElementById("messages").innerHTML += "Files in folder:<br>{file_list_html}";'
            )
        else:
            # The user picked something that's not a directory
            window.evaluate_js(
                'document.getElementById("messages").innerHTML += "<br>Not a valid directory!";'
            )
    else:
        # User canceled or no folder selected
        window.evaluate_js(
            'document.getElementById("messages").textContent = "No folder selected";'
        )

def main():
    # A simple HTML page with a <div> for messages
    html_content = '''
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head><title>Pick a Folder Example</title></head>
<body>
  <h1>Folder Picker Demo</h1>
  <div id="messages" style="white-space: pre-wrap; color: #333; font-family: sans-serif;"></div>
</body>
</html>
'''

    # Create a window that loads our minimal HTML
    window = webview.create_window('Folder Picker', html=html_content, width=600, height=400)

    # As soon as the window is ready, open_folder_dialog(window) is called
    webview.start(open_folder_dialog, window)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
"@ | Set-Content -Path "app.py"
