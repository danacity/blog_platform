# The Paradox of Knowledge

"Knowledge is power."

This phrase, attributed to Francis Bacon, has shaped organizational behavior for centuries. But there's a paradox here that undermines organizations every day:

**We say knowledge is our most valuable asset, yet we systematically fail to manage it properly.**

## The Knowledge Contradiction

In my career, I've observed this contradiction repeatedly:

- Organizations claim "our people are our greatest asset," but make no systematic effort to capture what those people know
- Executives stress the importance of "not reinventing the wheel," but create environments where knowledge sharing is difficult or disincentivized
- Companies invest millions in expertise, then let it walk out the door when employees leave

Why does this happen? The answer lies in how we think about knowledge itself.

## The Ownership Illusion

"When knowledge is perceived as personal property, sharing feels like giving away your competitive advantage."

Many professionals unconsciously view their knowledge as a form of job security. They ask themselves:

- If I share everything I know, will I still be valuable?
- If others can do what I do, will I become replaceable?
- If my expertise becomes common knowledge, will I lose status?

These concerns aren't irrational in organizations that reward individual achievement over collective intelligence. When promotion, recognition, and job security depend on being "the expert," knowledge hoarding becomes a rational strategy.

## The Department Fortress

This dynamic repeats at the department level:

- IT guards access to systems and technical knowledge
- Marketing protects its customer insights
- Product teams shield their roadmaps
- Finance restricts access to performance data

Each department builds walls around its information domain, creating silos that prevent the free flow of knowledge across the organization.

At a financial institution where I worked, accessing basic development tools required navigating a maze of permissions across multiple departments. The intention wasn't malicious – each team believed they were practicing good governance – but the collective effect paralyzed newcomers.

## The Perception/Reality Gap

Ask any executive if they support knowledge sharing, and they'll enthusiastically say yes. But observe what organizations actually measure and reward:

- Individual contribution metrics
- Department-specific goals
- Personal expertise and credentials
- Speed of execution (which can discourage documentation)

This creates a situation where knowledge sharing is verbally encouraged but practically discouraged.

## The Zero-Sum Fallacy

The fundamental error is treating knowledge as a zero-sum resource – assuming that if I give you my knowledge, I have less of it.

This ignores a fundamental truth: **Knowledge grows when shared.**

When I share what I know:

- Others can build upon it
- They can identify errors or improvements
- The organization develops collective expertise that exceeds individual capabilities
- I typically deepen my own understanding through the act of teaching

## Breaking the Paradox

So how do we resolve this paradox? It starts with recognizing knowledge for what it really is:

- A renewable resource that grows through sharing
- A collective asset that benefits from diverse contributions
- A living system that requires active circulation to remain relevant

In my next post, I'll explore [The Real Cost of Poor Knowledge Management](/posts/km2): – examining what happens when organizations fail to address this fundamental paradox.
