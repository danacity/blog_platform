## Pain

I'd like to share my experience about knowledge management and what it means to me.  At a simple level now it's management is a simple process of managing knowledge now seems easy but as it turns out I think this is a fundamental problem in every organization and every department. From employee on boarding to platform application to ai where all dependent on knowledge to do our job and when we don't have the knowledge needed to do our job we need to find it that could be finding it in a coworker it could be finding it in internal documentation or external documentation and along the way there's lots of reasons and failure points that make it harder than it should be.


Now it is power and without knowledge it's a lot harder to do your job. For example you might do something you're not supposed to it might take you 10 times longer to do something without the assistance of it of knowledge but what strikes me is odd is people think that sharing their knowledge is somehow limiting their own abilities to to help utilization so people end up sharing this don't share this knowledge they hoard employees like libraries of information necessary to do a job and yet when those people inevitably leave those new teams that acquired all those people their knowledge is then lost as well I find it out that we spend so much time talking about knowledge and on boarding and yet the documentation that people depend on is almost nonexistent or really hard to find search is inevitably a difficult problem at a lot of organizations sometimes departments have their own knowledge sources and and they have personalized documentation that that's not available to people outside of their group hoarding that knowledge and they even guard applications as if these applications and the knowledge inside of them and about them are somehow proprietary to a team hurting the larger organization to be able to take advantage of some of the best tools and resources available and not to mention that the knowledge dies so knowledge has a life expectancy that's related to what that knowledge is about so the longer it is between when we write down the knowledge to using it the chances of that knowledge being relevant is a lot less the temporal nature of it now and then to make matters worse when we have whole repositories taking up space that someone hopefully will find and hopefully we'll find useful but when they do inevitably they won't be able to update it because there's other people there's other limitations and rules.


Knowledge is a living breathing thing and sometimes just knowing who to ask will save you more time and effort than hours of searching or trying to find your own personal solution ai needs knowledge just like people need knowledge and it needs it to be relevant the prop needs to include enough information for the ai to digest the knowledge as well as the user's expectations to solve the problem. But there's lots of problems with this one is the search now we could simply search and embed entire knowledge bases only to have unrelated context come back and unrelated solutions and fundamentally employees are trying to solve that same problem and employees if they can't search for it in their node depository it's going to be very difficult for an ai to be able to search that now depository and without proper metadata tags and a proper management even AI with the best encoding my embedding model is doomed to fail.


Now there's a lot of problems that I've experienced in terms of knowledge management and I'm curious if you've had the same experience for example you're starting a new job and you don't even know how to accomplish the basis like for instance setting up python or how do you how to use python for a local development instead of spending minutes getting on boarded you spend hours and even days looking for the platform looking for who to talk to or who to ask when in reality it should be simple it should be that you are a data scientist and these are the things that data scientists need but yet we don't do that and every team has its own documentation every team has its own preferred applications for where it stores and how it stores with no respect for who the information is themed toward and have you ever tried to find somebody that has knowledge of something that you don't know the name of this is fundamentally one of the most interesting things to me is that if you don't know the name of something it's really hard to find it have you ever been left to fail by yourself quietly I've had numerous people that have talked to phd's and et cetera where they are looking and wanting to solve problems but they are left alone for too long with not enough resources and not enough guidance and then they failed to be expected but not no problem of their own but a problem of the solution which this they don't have that guidance they don't have that management they don't have that knowledge to know where to go they're left alone have you ever been told oh why don't you just do blank as if you should have known that this is that blank was how you do something

Now my experience said a large financial institution in terms of on boarding and finding what I needed to do to perform my job was exceptionally difficult there was platforms galore there was no clear way on how to do any of them how to do this or that or the other thing everything was spread across multiple platforms with multiple searches that were not really designed or not indexed properly where you could find your information and the and when you did find documentation it was often unclear it was outdated and organizations within the large organizations prevented some of this dissemination they prevented the sharing of knowledge for whatever reason I don't know they had separate logins for systems that warhead that were assumed everybody knew.

But as time went on I learned and I took notes and I focused my efforts on sharing what I thought others could benefit from if they found themselves in my situation how to set up Jupiter notebooks how to use a lab what tools and resources were available how to solve common problems and from time to time I got feedback and I helped people but ironically if I were to do it again I wouldn't have been able to because the systems which for me to share the knowledge would have no longer been available to the individual contributor it would have to bend from a department so the department would have to deem the knowledge that share a vote shareable which I can understand that but it adds more problems knowledge management to me is about maintaining structure and processes to make knowledge useful for everyone


#### Knowledge Management (Governance, Evaluation, and Improvement)
- **Definition:** The overarching framework that governs all stages of knowledge processing, including evaluation and continuous improvement.
- ##### **Includes:**
	- **Strategy Development:** Aligning knowledge processes with organizational goals.
	- **Policy Implementation:** Establishing guidelines and standards.
	- **Evaluation and Reflection:** Assessing the effectiveness of knowledge use and processes.
	- **Continuous Improvement:** Updating and refining knowledge based on insights gained.
	- **Cultural Development:** Fostering an environment of knowledge sharing and continuous learning.
	- **Performance Measurement:** Assessing the effectiveness of knowledge management activities
	- **User Feedback Collection:** Surveys, usage analytics, and user testing.
	- **Audits:** Periodically assess processes for compliance and efficiency.
- ##### **Explanation:**
	- By integrating **Knowledge Reflection** into **Knowledge Management**, this stage now encompasses the evaluation of knowledge processes, feedback collection, and the implementation of improvements. It ensures that all knowledge activities are aligned with organizational objectives and are continuously optimized.
- ##### **Alignment with Human Cognition:**
	- **Executive Functioning and Reflection:** Acts like the brain's management system, overseeing, regulating, and reflecting on all cognitive processes to enhance learning and performance.

Models outputs are like intuitions there is a level of uncertainty that is often quantifiable, which is not always the case for generative models, especially closed source models.  


### Dates

1. **Creation Date:**
    - **Definition:** When the knowledge asset was originally created. Track age of information/topic.
2. **Last Modified Date:**
    - **Definition:** When the content was last updated or edited. Tracks how current information is/how active information is being updated.
3. **Review Date (Last Reviewed Date):**
    - **Definition:** When the content was last reviewed for accuracy and relevance. Regular reviews help maintain the quality and reliability.
4. **Next Review Date:**
    - **Definition:** Scheduled date for the next content review. Which creates accountability by reminding stakeholders to update or verify information periodically.
5. **Publication Date:**
    - **Definition:** When the content was made available to the intended audience. For understanding its context within time-sensitive scenarios.
6. **Expiry Date (Expiration Date):**
    - **Definition:** When the content is no longer considered valid or should be re-evaluated. Incorporating an expiration date can help prevent the usage of outdated or obsolete information.
7. **Accessed Date (Last Accessed Date):**
    - **Definition:** When the content was last accessed by a user. Helps gauge the usefulness and popularity of the information, informing decisions about content updates or archiving.
8. **Approval Date:**
    - **Definition:** When the content was approved by a subject matter expert or authority. Adds credibility and ensures that only vetted information is shared within the organization.
9. **Effective Date:**
    - **Definition:** When the content becomes applicable or enforceable. Critical for policies, procedures, or guidelines that have a specific start date for implementation.
10. **Archival Date:**
    - **Definition:** When the content was moved to an archive. Assists in managing the lifecycle of knowledge assets and aids in record-keeping and compliance, this is most likely associated with some sort of formal archival process. 
#### Advanced date topics:
1. **Version Date:**
    - **Definition:** Date associated with a specific version of the content. Important for version control, allowing users to track changes over time and refer to previous iterations if needed.
	    - [Note] - can we automate this with github actions
2. **Retention End Date:**
    - **Definition:** When the content's retention period expires. Ensures compliance with data retention policies and helps determine when content can be deleted or needs to be re-evaluated.
3. **Distribution Date:**
    - **Definition:** When the content was distributed to users or stakeholders.
    - **Importance:** Useful for tracking communication efforts and ensuring that all intended recipients have received the information.
4. **Date Metadata Was Last Updated:**
    - **Definition:** When the metadata associated with the content was last modified.
    - **Importance:** Ensures that the metadata accurately reflects the current state of the content, which is essential for searchability and organization.

#### **Why These Dates Matter in Knowledge Management:**
- **Content Accuracy:** Keeping track of creation, modification, and review dates ensures that information remains accurate and up-to-date.
- **Compliance and Governance:** Dates like approval and retention end dates help meet regulatory requirements and organizational policies.
- **Efficient Retrieval:** Metadata dates improve searchability, allowing users to find the most relevant and recent information quickly.
- **Lifecycle Management:** Dates like expiry and archival dates assist in managing the content lifecycle, preventing clutter, and maintaining a clean knowledge base.
- **User Engagement:** Accessed dates provide insights into how often content is used, informing decisions about updates or training needs.

#### **Best Practices for Knowledge Management Metadata:**

- **Automate Date Tracking:** Use knowledge management systems that automatically capture and update these dates to reduce manual effort and errors.
- **Standardize Date Formats:** Implement a consistent date format (e.g., ISO 8601: YYYY-MM-DD) across all knowledge assets.
- **Set Reminders for Reviews:** Utilize the next review date to set automated reminders, ensuring content is regularly evaluated.
- **Leverage Version Control:** Keep a history of changes with associated dates to track the evolution of knowledge assets.
- **Ensure Accessibility:** Make metadata visible and accessible to users who need it, enhancing transparency and trust in the knowledge base.


Knowledge management is work it requires dedication and support of knowledge representation knowledge needs to represent the realities you live and the place in which the college is useful but one key problem is that people don't know who needs the knowledge and when they need the knowledge so we end up developing systems like rag which combines retrieval search augments it with the user's prompt and hopefully returns the correct answer and there's lots of alternatives to this but fundamentally what ends up getting in the way is the knowledge that's used in these ai systems is irrelevant in terms of how it's represented so if it's a faq where the user's asking a question and expecting an answer and what if there's an answer related to a question that's not asked but still relevant meaning embedding a answer in the same vector representation as a question is actually difficult when people spend far too much time trying to debug a system that they don't understand we try to put everything in context we put books and all that's going to solve it put the whole thing in there when fundamentally if there's no information related in that book that's useful that's just wasted but whereas if we combine what we know as humans with knowledge management best practices we're far more likely to get realistic results by managing our knowledge There's lots of different types of knowledge used in AI systems one of them is parametric knowledge or memory where the memory or knowledge is stored in the parameters of the neural network these are hard to override and this can lead to some hallucinations like for instance how to iterate a loop in python backwards is hard to prevent the LM from knowing even if no documentation is provided in context it's hard to prevent it from answering questions that it knows in its parameters to be correct now there's some ways to mitigate this but in general parametric knowledge is is facts that the model believes are are true about reality now there's other types of knowledge like procedural knowledge however procedural knowledge is different because it's a series of steps in more of a tree structure which is difficult because it requires a back and forth with the model are you experiencing this than this route if you're experiencing this then this route right and so without a model that interacts with a human like a human it's very difficult to troubleshoot it's very difficult to have those troubleshooting steps if this then this now models are getting better energetic systems will come a long way especially when you combine them with knowledge graphs but it's still very challenging to get the models to stop talking so much
