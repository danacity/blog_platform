# Knowledge as a Living Asset

## From Repository to Ecosystem

**From:** Knowledge as artifacts to preserve  
**To:** Knowledge as a living ecosystem to cultivate

## Cultivating Knowledge Together

### Adopt a Gardener's Mindset

- Prepare fertile ground (accessible platforms)
- Plant seeds (core documentation)
- Remove weeds (outdated content)
- Prune when needed (consolidation)
- Allow natural growth patterns

### Keep Knowledge Flowing

- Regular review cycles based on usage
- Cross-team knowledge exchange sessions
- Direct feedback paths to content owners
- Convert tacit knowledge to explicit documentation

### Measure What Matters

- **Usage patterns:** Is it being actively used?
- **Evolution rate:** How often is it improved?
- **Connection density:** Is it linked to related information?
- **Response time:** How quickly does it adapt?

### Support Knowledge Stewards

Identify and empower people who:

- Enjoy connecting information
- Create clarity from confusion
- Notice when knowledge is missing
- Help others find existing information

## The Cultural Shift Needed

**From** viewing documentation as a burden  
**To** seeing knowledge sharing as value creation

**From** rewarding individual expertise  
**To** celebrating collective intelligence

**From** treating questions as interruptions  
**To** welcoming them as growth opportunities

## The Payoff

When knowledge becomes everyone's responsibility, it takes care of the entire organizationâ€”creating a cycle of continuous improvement where:

- New team members onboard faster
- Solutions aren't repeatedly reinvented
- Expertise remains when people leave
- Teams make better decisions

_How is your team sharing responsibility for knowledge?_
